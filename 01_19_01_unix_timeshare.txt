# Unix

## Basics characteristics
* Everything look like a file
* I/O Devices
* Streaming model

## Mount
* Single naming hierarchy

## Links (hard links)
* File exists independent
* Directory links (maps)
  Names -> I-nodes
* If delete a file, decrease reference, if zero delete
* Cannot reference other file systems

## Permission (protected control transfer)
* set UID
* e.g. runs at the owner of the file
* sudo: run as root

## Shell redirect pipes
* fd0: stdin, fd1: stdout
* fork

## Multics: memory mapped, Unix, streaming
Multics uses hardware supported more sophisticated virtual address spaces:
segments (which worked well with memory mapped files) and rings (generalization
of the user-kernel mode into 8 protection levels)

## What is different from today's Unix?
* Groups
* Filesystem
* Name of the file, file size
* Network
* GUI
