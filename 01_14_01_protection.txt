Protection

At that point in time, they had very ad hoc implementations of protection/security, so he made a general paper re protection
Object - anything that you want to protect. Resources, segments, files, etc
    Name must be unforgeable (OS has to control them)
Domain - the context in which an object has rights to other objects
Access matrix - designate what permissions each domain has over each object
Control vs owner - control deals with the domain's point of view, whereas owner deals with the object.
Looking at individual rows of Access Control Matrix looks like capability, looking at columns is an ACL

Message System:
  consists of processes which share nothing and communicate with each other only by means of messages.

  Message: consists of an identification of the sending process followed by an arbitrary amount of data.
  Messages are received one at a time in the order in which they were sent.

  two major flaws:
    1. impossible to retain control over a runaway process
    2. an elaborate system of conventions is required to get processes to cooperate

Object System:
  a set of objects, a set of domains, and an access matrix or access function
