Monitor:
A collection of data and procedures
Mutual exclusion: 1) allows controlled acquisition and release of critical resources. 2) single anonymous lock automatically acquired and released at entry and exit
Data encapsulation: monitor procedures are “entry points” for accessing data

Rules for Monitors:
1. Any process can call a monitor procedure at any time
2. But only one process can be inside a monitor at any time (mutual exclusion)
3. No process can directly access a monitor’s local variables (data encapsulation)
4. A monitor may only access its local variables

“wait” operation: current process is put to sleep
“signal” operation: wakes up a sleeping process
condition variables: 1) May have different reasons for “waiting” or “signaling”. 2) Processes waiting on a particular condition enter its queue

Scheduled Waits:
A waiting process is given a number. The process with the lowest number gets woken up first.

Proof rules:
I {b.wait} I&B
I&B {b.signal} I
I: the invariant
B: the condition that a process waiting on b wants to be true before its woken up
b: the condition variable
